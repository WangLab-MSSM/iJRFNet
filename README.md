## Overview
Integrative Joint Random Forest (iJRF) characterizes the regulatory system between miRNAs and mRNAs using a network model. iJRF is designed to work under the high-dimension low-sample-size regime, and can borrow information across different treatment conditions to achieve more accurate network inference. It also effectively takes into account prior information of miRNAâ€“mRNA regulatory relationships from existing databases.

## Installation
